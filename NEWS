cdfquantreg 1.0.4 (2016-04-05)
---------------------------
  
  * Update the package manual
  * Reclassify the shapes of different cdf distributions (see ?cdfqrFamily)
  * Fixed the bug in producing negative parameter estimation results and warning message when using the Kumaraswamy distribution

cdfquantreg 1.0.3 (2016-03-05)
---------------------------
  
Fixed bugs:
  * Fixed minor issues in output.
  * Fixed issues caused by extreme values (approching 0 or 1) in plotting the density function.

cdfquantreg 1.0.2 (2016-02-08)
---------------------------
  
Fixed bugs:
  * Fixed problems in calling arcsinh-X distributions.
  * Minor improvement for ploting user defined distributions in `plot.cdfqr()`.


cdfquantreg 1.0.1 (2016-01-25)
---------------------------
  
Fixed bugs and minor improvements:
  * Fixed namespace issues relating to functions: `rq()`,`qq()` and `pq()`.
  * Minor improvement for `print.cdfqr()` and `summary.cdfqr()`.
  * Fixed the problem in `qrBugs` in handling data object when the provided model is a null model.
  * Improvement for `plot.cdfqr()` with additional plot of the fitted results.
  * Changed the naming of the _precision_ model/coefficients (model $sigma$  of a distribution) to the _dispersion_ model/coefficiets to reduce the confusion (as $sigma$ is a dispersion parameter).
