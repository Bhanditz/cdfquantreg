\title{Overview of the family of distributions}
\usage{
cdfqrFamily()
}
\value{
A list of distributions that are available in the current version of package.
}
\description{
The cdfquantreg family consists of the currently available distributions that can be used to fit quantile regression models via the cdfquantreg() function.
}
\details{
The cdfquantreg package includes a two-parameter family of distributions for 
modeling random variables on the (0, 1) interval by applying the cumulative 
distribution function (cdf) of one \dQuote{parent} distribution to the 
quantile function of another. \cr
The naming of these distributions are \dQuote{parent - child} or 
\dQuote{fd - sd}, where \dQuote{fd} is the parent distribution, and \dQuote{sd} 
is the child distribution. \cr
The distributions have four characteristic shapes: Logit-logistic, bimodal, trimodal, and finite-tailed. 
Here is the list of currently available distributions.
